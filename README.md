# FL Studio Brainwave Tracks - Individual Setups

## 1. Delta Waves (0.5-4 Hz) - "Deep Sleep & Healing"

### Technical Setup:
- **Sine Wave Generator**: 3xOsc with pure sine wave at 1-2 Hz
- **White Noise Ratio**: Very subtle (10-15% of main signal)
- **Recommended Length**: 60+ minutes for sleep sessions
- **EQ Settings**:
  - Low-pass filter at 100 Hz
  - Slight boost around 40-60 Hz for warmth
  - Roll off completely above 150 Hz

### Sound Design Elements:
- Add extremely subtle deep ocean sounds (EQ'd to remove higher frequencies)
- Consider adding very quiet "resonant bowl" type sounds occurring every 30-60 seconds
- Apply gentle sidechain compression triggered by the resonant sounds
- Very light reverb (5-10% wet) with long decay (5+ seconds)

### Export Settings:
- 32-bit WAV
- -12dB average level (leaves plenty of headroom)
- Apply gentle limiting to prevent any sudden peaks

## 2. Theta Waves (4-7 Hz) - "Creative Meditation"

### Technical Setup:
- **Sine Wave Generator**: 3xOsc with sine wave at 6 Hz
- **White Noise Ratio**: Gentle (15-20% of main signal)
- **Recommended Length**: 30-45 minutes for meditation/creative sessions
- **EQ Settings**:
  - Low-pass filter at 200 Hz
  - Subtle presence boost around 80-120 Hz
  - Roll off above 300 Hz

### Sound Design Elements:
- Integrate soft flowing water sounds (heavily EQ'd)
- Consider adding very subtle wind chimes or singing bowls at low volume
- Apply stereo widening effect to the white noise only
- Add gentle pulsing effect that follows the 6 Hz rhythm
- Medium reverb (15-20% wet) with moderately long decay (3-4 seconds)

### Export Settings:
- 32-bit WAV
- -10dB average level
- Apply subtle compression (2:1 ratio, slow attack, slow release)

## 3. Alpha Waves (8-13 Hz) - "Focused Relaxation"

### Technical Setup:
- **Sine Wave Generator**: 3xOsc with sine wave at 10 Hz
- **White Noise Ratio**: Balanced (20-25% of main signal)
- **Recommended Length**: 25-40 minutes for study/relaxation sessions
- **EQ Settings**:
  - Low-pass filter at 300 Hz
  - Boost around 150-200 Hz for presence
  - Very subtle high-shelf boost above 1kHz for clarity

### Sound Design Elements:
- Add soft rainfall sounds (EQ'd to be gentle)
- Consider soft forest ambience in the background
- Subtle stereo panning automation (very slow movement)
- Light chorus effect on the white noise layer
- Medium-light reverb (10-15% wet) with medium decay (2-3 seconds)

### Export Settings:
- 32-bit WAV
- -8dB average level
- Gentle multiband compression

## 4. Beta Waves (14-30 Hz) - "Productive Focus"

### Technical Setup:
- **Sine Wave Generator**: 3xOsc with sine wave at 20 Hz
- **White Noise Ratio**: More prominent (25-30% of main signal)
- **Recommended Length**: 20-30 minutes for work/study sessions
- **EQ Settings**:
  - Band-pass filter between 100 Hz and 1 kHz
  - Boost around 300-500 Hz for clarity
  - Allow some higher frequencies for awareness

### Sound Design Elements:
- Add subtle coffee shop ambience (distant murmurs, no distinct voices)
- Consider adding occasional typewriter or keyboard sounds
- Apply slow filter modulation on the white noise
- Use slight delay (15-20ms) on one channel for width
- Light reverb (5-10% wet) with short decay (1-2 seconds)

### Export Settings:
- 32-bit WAV
- -6dB average level
- Moderate compression (3:1 ratio)

## 5. Gamma Waves (30-100 Hz) - "Cognitive Enhancement"

### Technical Setup:
- **Sine Wave Generator**: 3xOsc with sine wave at 40 Hz
- **White Noise Ratio**: Prominent but balanced (30-35% of main signal)
- **Recommended Length**: 15-20 minutes for intense mental work
- **EQ Settings**:
  - Band-pass filter between 200 Hz and 3 kHz
  - Presence boost around 1-2 kHz
  - Allow higher frequencies up to 5 kHz

### Sound Design Elements:
- Integrate subtle electronic ambient textures
- Consider adding distant city sounds (heavily processed)
- Apply rhythmic filter modulation at 40 Hz
- Use Haas effect for stereo enhancement
- Minimal reverb (3-5% wet) with very short decay (0.5-1 second)

### Export Settings:
- 32-bit WAV
- -5dB average level
- Tight compression (4:1 ratio) with fast release

## Additional Production Tips for All Tracks:

1. **Layer Approach**: Create 2-3 versions of each frequency and layer them with slight variations
2. **Dynamic Movement**: Add very subtle volume automation (Â±1-2dB) over long periods (3-5 minutes)
3. **Transition Planning**: Add 30-second intro/outro segments for easier transitions between states
4. **Testing**: Always test with headphones to ensure no phase cancellation issues
5. **Monitoring**: Keep peaks below -3dB to prevent potential issues when listening at higher volumes
